## Project Overview

This project investigates the operational parameters of wind turbines to understand the conditions contributing to equipment failure. Using sensor and environmental data such as wind speed, power output, internal temperatures, and failure status, the analysis aims to identify key factors linked to turbine failures. The insights generated can support predictive maintenance and improve turbine reliability.

## Exploratory Data Analysis EDA Summary

### 1. Failure Distribution
- The dataset is imbalanced, with fewer failure instances compared to non-failure cases.
- The `Failure_status` column clearly distinguishes operational turbines from failed ones.
- Failure records reveal important patterns that help isolate operational conditions leading to turbine failure.

### 2. Key Influential Features

- **Power Output:**
  - Very high or very low power values correspond to a higher failure rate.
  - Operating at extreme power outputs may stress the turbine.

- **Gear Oil Temperature:**
  - Failures occurred only when gear oil temperature was high (>90Â°C).
  - High temperature indicates overheating and possible lubrication failure.

- **Gear Box Inlet Temperature:**
  - 100% failure rate observed when temperature exceeded 50Â°C.

- **Ambient and Nacelle Temperatures:**
  - High ambient temperature alone does not strongly correlate with failure.
  - However, combined with moderate power (1â€“2), failure rate reaches 100%.

### 3. Wind Speed & Other Factors
- Wind speed, rotor speed, yaw angle, and wind direction did not show strong correlations with failure.

### 4. Feature Interactions
- Compound risk conditions identified:
  - Moderate power (1â€“2) + High ambient temperature (>20Â°C) â†’ 100% failure.
  - High Gear Box Inlet Temp + High Gear Oil Temp â†’ 100% failure.
  
Failures are multifactorial and often result from extreme conditions combined.
